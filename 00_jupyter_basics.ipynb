Whether Magics are available on a kernel is a decision that is made by the kernel developer on a per-kernel basis. To work properly, Magics must use a syntax element which is not valid in the underlying language. For example, the IPython kernel uses the <code>%</code> syntax element for Magics as <code>%</code> is not a valid unary operator in Python.
